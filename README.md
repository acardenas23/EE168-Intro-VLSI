# EE168-Intro-VLSI
This repository contains the labs I completed in my Intro To VLSI course at UC Riverside. I contains the IC layouts I drew using Synopsis Custom Design Tools. The purpose of including the link to this repository is so that my future employer can gain a better understanding of what my previous experience with designing IC layouts has consisted of. I included my lab reports which contain links to my lab demoes which show my work more clearly.
